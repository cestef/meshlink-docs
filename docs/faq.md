Read the [Introduction](/docs/intro) page. duh.

### What's the difference between Meshlink and [insert other mesh networking app here] ?

Meshlink is purely a messaging app. It does not have any other features, such as voice calls, video calls, or group chats. It is also not a social media app, and does not have any features that would make it one. This is just a project for my maturity work. I'm not trying to compete with any other apps.

No.

### Why is it called MeshLink ?

I don't know. I just thought it sounded cool.
